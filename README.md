#Infectious-Disease-Analysis-Visualization-

Project Overview
This is an end-to-end data science project that demonstrates a complete workflow from data acquisition to predictive modeling and business intelligence visualization. The project involved creating a unique dataset by scraping data on infectious diseases, building machine learning models to predict disease attributes, and creating an interactive dashboard to analyze the findings.

Key Features
Web Scraping & Data Creation: A custom dataset was built from scratch by scraping a medical website using Python, BeautifulSoup, and Pandas.

Predictive Modeling: Multiple machine learning models were trained and evaluated to predict disease characteristics based on symptoms and other attributes, achieving a top accuracy of 96.5% with a Random Forest classifier.

Interactive BI Dashboard: A comprehensive Power BI dashboard was designed to explore correlations between diseases, symptoms, vaccine availability, and treatment coverage.

Project Structure
Data_Acquisition_Web_Scraping.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook containing the Python code used to scrape the website and create the initial dataset.

Data_Modeling.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook detailing the data cleaning, feature engineering, model training (Logistic Regression, Random Forest), and evaluation process.

infections_list_cleaned.csv: The final, cleaned dataset produced by the web scraping notebook.
